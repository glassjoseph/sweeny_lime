      <h3>Do I need Lime?</h3>
      <p>Lime makes your fertilizer dollars go farther, because the plants have less ability to make use of fertilizer if thereâ€™s a low soil pH. Lime raises soil pH.</p>

      <h5>When to lime</h5>
      <p>Lime can be applied any time of year that the ground will support the heavy trucks. It can take 45-60 days for lime to correct the pH of a field, so ideally you. But the best time to  Avoid the busy season by calling us in the summer for hay and pasture land.</p>
